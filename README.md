# Dashboard-v2

Second iteration of Plexus Inventory Management, except redesigned from the ground up now that I understand the required features.

## Short (Incomplete) Summary of Changes
- Switching to Docker for portability
- Switching from function-based views to class-based views
- Building a better and more beautiful UI
- Redesigning database layout for better scalability and optimization
- Including more features in the former "workflow" page in order to create a full "dashboard" module
    - This will provide more detailed information regarding tickets and hardware tracking
    - Depending on feature creep, this may replace a helpdesk application entirely
- Bug ticketing system for feature requests and bug reports (tentative)
- An infinite amount of generics to boilerplate everything I possibly can
- A hardware page for tracking utilites such as switches, adapters, and other generic devices that don't need a full inventory entry
